  If you would like to experience the genuine Africa, live with a Senegalese
  family and at the same time make a contribution to your fellow human beings,
  then take this chance! Come and work with us!

To speak French, which is the national language, is not necessary. The pupils in the “Lycee” learn English but otherwise people speak Wolof or French. The Talibés speak mostly Poular, one of the other ethnic languages and Wolof. You can manage to get a long way with body language and a nicer and more sympathetic people than the Senegalese are not easy to find.

Your duties at the Centre will be to teach ABC, English and maybe a little French and Maths. You will also be a General Playleader. If you want, you can also help in the Clinic, taking care of wounds – the children get lots off wounds on their feet and legs.

There will be opportunities to make excursions, for example, to Cap Skirring, a tourist place by the sea, Kafountine, a fishing village also by the sea and the paradisiac islands Carabane and Kachouane in the Casamance River.

On Friday evenings we usually meet somewhere in the city to have a drink together and there are also some hotels with swimming pools to visit during your free time.
