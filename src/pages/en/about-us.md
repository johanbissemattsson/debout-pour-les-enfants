# Talib√©er
The street children in Senegal are called talibans which means disciples. They have been relayed by their parents, sometimes already at the age of four, to the Koran schools operated by Marabouer. The intention is that the boys will learn the Quran beyond which may take up to ten years. Many of the children do not meet their families throughout that time. Most of the day, they spend on the streets to beg for food and money for the Marabou. The children are dirty with broken clothes and usually without shoes.

# Daaras
There is the name of a Koran school. Many are located in places that we would consider to be dumped. The Talibans are sleeping on plastic or bastards lying directly on the dirty floor. Here they also spend the time for their studies with the Marabouen. Access to the toilet is of course, but not a lot of hygiene.

# UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and what we want to achieve
Senegal has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child but does not do enough to follow it. The Taliban is a problem that has been noted in recent years but changes are delaying.

In the center we have in Ziguinchor we want to give the children, primarily the Taliban, an opportunity to be ordinary children playing, playing soccer, drawing and reading books. We also want to teach French, which is the official language of Senegal, and also in English. When the children grow older they realize that they need to learn something more than the Quran and they are very motivated for study.
